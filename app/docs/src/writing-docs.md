# Writing documentation

We're so glad you want to write some documentation! Here are some guidelines to help you along the way.

## Professional Voice

Regardless of the type of documentation you are writing, the voice should be professional and simple. A great piece of documentation has should be at or below a high school reading level. Favor gender neutral language (you/your/they/them).

## No Slang, Humor, or Sarcasm

Avoid slang, humor, and sarcasm. It's more fun to write, but it's easy to get lost in translation.

## No Marketing

Documentation is not the place for marketing copy. People come to the documentation to learn how to use the product, or solve their problems. Not to be sold on why it's valuable.

## Types of Documentation

There are four different types of documentation, each with their own purpose and flavor.

### Tutorials

These teach people how to use System Initiative through using System Initiative. Their goal is to inform people about how to use the functionality of System Initiative. A good tutorial requires as little outside knowledge as possible to show the task. With that in mind, examples should still be realistic - avoid synthetic examples that exist purely to demonstrate functionality.

All tutorials should have a video walkthrough recorded. If you aren't a System Initiative employee, don't worry - go ahead and write the tutorial, and we'll record the video.

Each section of the tutorial should have an image, highlighting the most important interaction for the section.

## Images and Screen Shots

We use [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) to produce our screen shots.

Configure your colorpicker to have a color preset for #ffd41e. When making up a screenshot, make sure you select this color by right-clicking the resulting image before you mark it up.

Full screen shots should include the application, but not the browser.

Name the images after the section they reference, in a sub-folder named after the documentation they are used in. For example, the image for the `Add a Secret` section of the [Getting Started](./tutorials/getting-started) tutorial is named `getting-started/add-a-secret.png`.
