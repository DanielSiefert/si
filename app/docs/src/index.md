and faster to deploy applications, build infrastructure, and manage them over
time.

## Key Features

### Short Feedback Loops

Every change is validated and qualified immediately. Reconciliation can happen
individually or in batches, making application changes orders of magnitude
faster.

### High Intelligence

Configuration can be inferred through the relationships between models. Changing
a value at the source cascades throughout all the dependent models, making
complex configuration easy to express. Code is automatically generated from the
model.

### Easy Collaboration

Fully multiplayer coding and interactive diagrams make working together more
like Figma and Notion, and less like GitHub. Everything is open source, with
integrated open source module sharing.

### Natural Context Windows

The entire life cycle is built in to a single power tool. Customization happens
in the application. New experiences are built around the data.
