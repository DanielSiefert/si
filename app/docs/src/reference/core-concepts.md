# Core Concepts

## Full Fidelity Model

A full fidelity model of the resources in your system - such as:

- AWS
- Docker
- Kubernetes

## Qualify the Model

We then qualify the model to give real time feedback on its suitability Use
relationships between models to infer configuration

## Automatically Generate the Necessary Code

Automatically generate necessary code

## Fully programmable

Fully programmable and customizable from within the application

## Bi-directional reconciliation

Bi-directional reconciliation of the simulation with the real system (and in the
future, automatic creation of the simulation)
