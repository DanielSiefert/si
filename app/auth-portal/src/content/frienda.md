Welcome to System Initiative!

This is an invite-only preview release,
intended to let you experience System Initiative and for us to shake out
the (probably many) issues you might have. We ask that you not speak
publicly about your use (positively or negatively), share screenshots,
etc. There are private channels we will invite you to in Discord where you
will be able to discuss System Initiative with us, and with other
participants in the preview. We're not asking you to sign an NDA - but we
are relying on your good-will and judgement as a friend of System
Initiative.

Thank you!
