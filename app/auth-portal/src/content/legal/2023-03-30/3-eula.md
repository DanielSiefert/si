Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. What, what, ma? She's just trying to keep you respectable. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Its good.

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Are those my clocks I hear? You have this thing hooked up to the car?

You bet. Stop it. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.

Marty, such a nice name. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Doc. You do? Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.
