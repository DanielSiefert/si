## Install and run System Initiative

We're currently working on implementing a SaaS version of System Initiative that will alleviate the need to install any software. 

In the meantime, there's 2 alternatives: 

* You can build from source, using buck2 and tilt. It takes a little bit to get started but the end result is a full development environment that mirrors what the team is doing and is at the moment the most stable way to use System Initiative.

* We can invite you to a private workspace as a playground. This is ephemeral and should be considered as such. This environment would be used to validate one of your ideas or to get some hands-on experience with System Initiative. 


In both cases, please [join the Discord](https://discord.com/invite/system-init) and reach out to @SI_keeb for any help or assistance.
