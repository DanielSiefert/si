## Next Steps

### What's next for the product?

Here are some of the things we'll be working on:

* Making it easy to add new functionality and share it
* Adding more coverage for assets, in particular, AWS services
* Discovery and bidirectional updates (building a model from your resources and updating models from resources)
* Production deployments
* A "Bring Your Own Cloud" SaaS offering

We would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

### Talk to us

You have _no idea_ how good it feels to have people we can talk to about System Initiative! You would make our day if you asked us questions about how things work, where we're heading, DevOps, philosophy, etc.

[Let's talk on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/955539345538957342/1080953018788364288).

### Schedule an interview


[Lets talk on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/system-init).

Weâ€™d love to schedule a half-hour Zoom interview with you. [Please schedule time with Adam Jacob (CEO), Anna Saulwick (Director of Product), and Mark Dennard (Director of UX) via our Calendly](https://calendly.com/system_initiative/user-interview).


### Collaborate

We're excited for DevOps builders to get involved and start modeling and building systems in System Initiative, so please join us in the Discord, talk about the Assets you want to see, and start making stuff with us! 

### Use System Initiative for real

You're someone who likes to try things early and is willing to deal with the rough edges - we are too. If you've got a project that you think is a good fit for using System Initiative, let us know, and we can get together to understand more about it, and what you'll need to see in the product to be successful.
