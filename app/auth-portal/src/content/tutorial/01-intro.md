## Welcome to System Initiative!

We’re so excited to share what we’ve been building with you, and for you to help us shape the second wave of DevOps.

This open source release allows you to install System Initiative and customize it to your needs. It is ready for **developers** and **experts** in our space: those who want to contribute to the project by extending and improving the system, and those that are ready to dig in with us to build and run their infrastructure in production.  

We ask that you:

  * Run through this tutorial to the end
  * Fill out a couple of surveys as you go
  * Talk about your experience or get help on Discord
  * Customize System Initiative to your needs, or work directly with us to build your whole system in production
  * Participate in a short interview about your experience

In return, you will receive:

  * Our everlasting gratitude
  * Our help in making System Initiative work for you 
  * The ability to directly influence our direction and the product
  * A particularly sweet bundle of amazing swag

You’re going to:

1. Download and run a the System Initiative launcher
2. See how System Initiative works by deploying a containerized web application to an AWS EC2 instance
