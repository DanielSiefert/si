## Welcome to System Initiative!

We’re so excited to share what we’ve been building with you and for you to help us shape
the second wave of DevOps.

This invite-only preview release allows you to experience System Initiative and for us to shake out any issues you might
encounter. It’s intended for you **as a developer** and **expert** in our space - it’s ready to play with and hack
around on but not yet ready for serious production use.

We ask that you:

  * Run through this tutorial to the end
  * Fill out a couple of surveys as you go
  * Talk about your experience or get help in the Discord support channel
  * Explore the source code, and contribute if you’re so moved
  * Participate in a short interview about your experience

In return, you will receive:

  * Our everlasting gratitude
  * The ability to directly influence our direction and the product
  * A sense of personal accomplishment
  * A particularly sweet bundle of amazing swag

### What you’re going to do

You’re going to:

1. Run a development instance of System Initiative
2. Deploy a containerized web application to an AWS EC2 instance
3. Clean up the resources you created in AWS
4. Customize System Initiative by writing TypeScript code

As you progress through the tutorial, we will automatically update the index on the left to let you know you’re ready to
move on to the next step. Let’s go!
