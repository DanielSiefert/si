## Welcome to System Initiative!

We’re so excited to share what we’ve been building with you and for you to help us shape
the second wave of DevOps.

This invite-only preview release allows you to experience System Initiative and for us to shake out any issues you might
encounter. It’s intended for you **as a developer** and **expert** in our space - it’s ready to play with and hack
around on but not yet ready for serious production use.

We ask that you:

  * Run through this tutorial to the end
  * Fill out a couple of surveys as you go
  * Talk about your experience or get help in the private Team 1 discord channels
  * Explore the source code, and contribute if you’re so moved
  * Participate in a short interview about your experience

In return, you will receive:

  * Our everlasting gratitude
  * The ability to directly influence our direction and the product
  * A sense of personal accomplishment
  * A particularly sweet bundle of amazing swag

A few things to get out of the way, then we’ll get on with the show.

### FrieNDA

We ask that you not speak publicly about your experience (positively or negatively). You will have access to private
channels on the System Initiative Discord, where you can discuss anything you like with us (and the other participants
in the preview). We’re not asking you to sign an NDA - but we trust your good-will and sound judgment as a friend of
System Initiative, Inc.

If you must talk to someone about your experience - we understand. Please do it privately, and make sure they understand
it’s a secret.

**Things you should do:**

* Talk with folks on the private Team 1 Discord channels
* Tell us what you love about the product
* Tell us your thoughts on how we could improve
* If you speak privately about your experience outside our Discord, make sure you tell folks that it’s a secret

**Things you should not do:**

* Talk with folks on the non-Team 1 Discord channels
* Post screenshots on social media or anywhere else
* Talk to the media
* Talk publicly about your experience with System Initiative, positively or negatively. Feel free to say, "I just experienced something super cool, can’t wait to talk about it" - but don’t say what_ you experienced. ;)

### What you’re going to do

You’re going to:

1. Run a development instance of System Initiative
2. Deploy a containerized web application to an AWS EC2 instance
3. Clean up the resources you created in AWS
4. Customize System Initiative by writing TypeScript code

As you progress through the tutorial, we will automatically update the index on the left to let you know you’re ready to
move on to the next step. Let’s go!
