# Repository Structure

While there are other directories in the project, these are primarily where
most of the interesting source code lives and how they are generally organized:

| Directory    | Description                                                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app/`       | Web front ends, GUIs, or other desktop applications            |
| `bin/`       | Backend programs, CLIs, servers, etc.                          |
| `component/` | Docker container images and other ancillary tooling            |
| `lib/`       | Supporting libraries and packages for services or applications ||
