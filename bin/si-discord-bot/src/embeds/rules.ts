***3. Roles:***
Please select roles that apply to you in the ${getChannelMention("get-roles")} channel so that other community members can know more about you.

***4. Channels:***
We talk about all things related to DevOps, cloud computing, software development, and other nerdy topics in general in the ***ðŸ’¬ PUBLIC ðŸ’¬*** category. Please keep channels on topic. If you would like to suggest a channel for a new topic, let a member of ${getRoleMention("Team SI")} know.
