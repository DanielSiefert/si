# SI Bot

This is a simple discord bot. It's only really useful right now for managing the embed messages
in channels like "welcome" and "user". We can keep it offline 99% of the time. It might get
smarter as our needs change.

# Local Setup Instructions

In order to run the bot locally, you will need to export the Discord Token in a local .envrc file in this root directory.

You will also need to run `direnv allow` at the root to enable the environment variable.
